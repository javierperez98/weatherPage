## `Description`

<!-- Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project.
What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? What problem does it solve? What did you learn? -->

- In this project I created a Desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile responsive weather forecast webpage.
- The layout was created using Bootstrap v4.
- The weather data was provided using Jquery and Open weather API.
- I really tested myself creating this webpage when it came to Javascript and Jquery because it is an area I lack in.
- None the less I feel very proud of the page I created and Learned a lot in the process.
- I learned how to properly use Jquery functions and syntax, Bootstrap design and Javascript syntax.
