# Weather Forecast Page

## Description

- In this project I created a Desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile responsive weather forecast webpage.
- The layout was created using Bootstrap v4.
- The weather data was provided using Jquery and Openweather API.
- I really tested myself creating this webpage when it came to Javascript and Jquery beacuse it is an area I lack in.
- None the less I feel very proud of the page I created and Learned a lot in the process.
- I learned how to properly use Jquery functions and syntax, Bootstrap design and Javascript syntax.
